To the people of Israel has the truth been given FIRST and then to GentileS. You are favoured to come from Abraham. Do not be stiff-necked. Return to the Glory of Israel - YHWH.

76,Meaningless nothingness.,NHS
77,"Damn, makes a good case.",NHS
78,The issue with what in my mind I think the lgbtq movement of today has become is that they put such a huge amount of focus on things that are pretty much irrelevant to most people in the world. They want to call out people who by mistake misgender someone at one point and they shame and bully that person until that persons life is ruined by all the hate. They claim to be against all forms of hate and bullying but they are the ones who are doing much of the hate and bullying that goes on today with sll the people that dont share exactly the same view as they do. They also dont focus enough on real issues as how lgbtq people are treated in islamic countries and growing up gay or trans in countries in which it is a much bigger issue than it is in the us for example.,NHS

She is one of the most privileged individuals ever to have walked the Earth: she is an Oxford student! Yet she stands there complaining about heteronormative privilege? Im sure fat, ugly short heteronormative white men experience microaggression all the time from people who arent enamoured by their existence. This is getting ridiculous. Identity politics is poison: we each have advantages and disadvantages. Those of us who are privileged and  who have fortitude focus on the glass being half full and lead creative, fulfilling lives; while weak privileged individuals view their almost-full cup as not  overflowing - they embrace the victim role, their audiences subsequently pitty them like they would wounded children, and they end up leading bitter, uncreative and unfulfilled lives. Correct me if Im wrong.",HS
91,"My problem with victimizing people in the west is it is largely exaggerated. Micro-aggressions is in the name. Micro. How did we go from beating and killing people out of intolerance. To validating punching idiots like Richard Spencer in the face? If someone is not causing physical violence to you, than why do you allow other peoples words effect you so profoundly?? Offense is taken far more than its given in modern western societies and yet we act like hate crimes are running rampant and jumping out of bushes. This kind mentality leads people to believing their victims to outside forces their entire lives. Not only is that tragic its not progressive to our society. Its quite literally regressive.",NHS

They should spend their time and energy fighting for a minority group that they have no obligation to fight for but, at every turn, make sure to undergo appropriate self flagellation for their crime of being straight and cis, and make sure to kiss the asses of their LGBTQ+ masters. How narcissistic.Sure, some allies are self-congratulatory. But many more are sincere in their desire to help.

He is not the only one with same sex parents,  It is the world he will be growing up in, and old people like those on the panel are the ones who need to be educated. There are good and bad people in the world regardless of sexuality or gender so we cannot paint everyone with the same brush. Whether or not this is taught in school, these children will learn about it because they will have friends who are gay or who have same sex parents they will see it on tv, in the movies and in their communities. We had this very same argument about sex education in school and in spite of all the ringing of hands and predictions of doom and now it is the norm, and LGBTQ falls directly under sex education so why shouldnt it be included? As for grooming, we could just as easily say that by banning any conversations about LGBTQ in school or at home (Dont say Gay, pink is for girls blue is for boys, girls play with dolls and boys play with trucks) that the straight community is grooming (or bullying) children into being straight. Leave the kids alone and let them be free to choose how to live their lives. As far as the American education system, there are more things to worry about than sex ed classes.",NHS

They move on with life,   1 third of men in the US, dont have sex for years,  they just work, engineers,  intelligent men,  workers, builders,   they are quiet about their sexuality,      most women also go for men with lots of money,  no body complain and riot against lazy women who are gold diggers at large!!   Men just deal with it,       92% of women date and have sex ,  how is that ?   It means they all go for the 10% of men who have all the women they want at will.         Life is not fair,   and we are not on earth to only  fulfill all desires. humans learn to adapt to even severe circumstances, and women file for divorce 87% of the time, which always ends with men losing their savings and children.       Again, life is not fair, on the otherside, women chose to be with the bad and corrupt men,  then get abused by these men, well, also life isnt fair.     Cancer is among 1 out of 4 people, and when it happens, spouses tend to ditch, and the person with cancer has to survive with depression,or die alone, life isn’t fair.      Animals, who are and should be equal to human and have the right to live on earth, get killed, and they call it a shooting sport,       life is not fair.     Children born with deformities,  and have to endure a lonely life thereafter, they get rejected by their own society, but they strive to survive, they tough it up,  the world is far from perfect perid.   So,  if somebody is confused about their gender identity,  they keep it to themselves, and the world has real problems to tackle.       We live in a free society because its protected by men who sucrifice their young lives to build this empire,  and then others want to abuse this freedom and reap all the advantages unjustly,  just because there are degenerative personalities in politics who love to confuse the masses and place irrelevant issues to create unnecessary large debates among peoples to confuse people and exhaust the mind of individuals to overlook the true pressing problems…",NHS

591,"As a gay man (who is also anglo-catholic), I have some very strong opinions on the education of kids regarding sexuality, gender, sex and relationships, and the handling of bullies.  Heads up: this one is likely to be a long post.I realised I was gay when I was 14, I was outed at 15 and by 16 Id been beaten up to the point of having to be hospitalised just because of my sexuality.  3 of the attacks happened on school grounds, one was witnessed by a teacher, another by the principal.  Every time I was told it was my fault for being gay.  I should point out Id had heart surgery, I was awaiting more heart surgery because I had several cardiac conditions and it was common knowledge among staff, students, and parents that I was the disabled kid and so when I was beaten up the bullies would try their best to punch or kick my chest to cause a dangerous arrhythmia.  When I wasnt being physically attacked I was called names, and there was even a teacher who thought it appropriate to stop the lesson he was teaching because he heard 4 boys at the back of the room talking about me and using slurs, and instead of stopping them he joined in and encouraged the rest of the class to as well.  What did the school do?  Tell my parents and I that again, if I didnt want the abuse I shouldnt have come out, and when they were told I never came out, I was outed whilst I was in the hospital and came back to a school where everyone suddenly knew my secret, we were told if I couldnt handle others views then I wasnt going to do well in life so I either needed to toughen up or be straight.  School was hell.  So, I agree something needs to change, but then Id also argue, based on how things are now, and I left high school in 2003, that things have changed, and I think thats, in part, due to homosexuality being taught during sex ed.  When I had sex ed it couldnt be talked about despite someone asking questions about it.  I strongly feel that sent a message to all the kids that there was something wrong with being gay.  It also meant that beyond knowing condoms prevent STIs I had no idea how to be physically intimate with another male, and I ended up learning through less than ideal means.  So, I think homosexual sex needs to be taught along side heterosexual sex - if youre telling 15yr olds how to have intercourse, teach them about vaginal and anal sex - it will benefit females too as the number of female friends who have come to me to discuss doing anal with their partners and ask how to prevent the pain or bleeding is shocking - straight people do anal too, itll help keep them safe if they know how to do it correctly.All that said, teach it at an appropriate age.  Pre-pubescent children dont need to know about sex, they shouldnt be doing sexual things and if they are theres an issue.  In healthcare, as in teaching, were taught young kids who know about sex may be abuse victims.  If were telling them about vaginas and penises and how they work and how to use them to make a baby or pleasure ourselves and others then when a child talks about it, it could be brushed off as a conversation about what theyve been taught in sex ed at a young age rather than a sign of abuse - we lose one of the identifying factors in sexual abuse of children.  Have a discussion regarding puberty at 11 or 12, and then another class at 14 or 15 about sex, STIs, contraception etc.  Its rare children younger than 14 are fooling around or experimenting of their own accord, and theres no need to teach children about sex before they are likely to be exploring that side of themselves in my view.  Children dont have their innocence for very long and I dont know why people - governments and so on - want to take their innocence even earlier, let kids be kids!  You could explain when talking to younger kids that love comes in many forms, a lot of men and women love each other but there are some men who love other men and some women who love other women, and that may be beneficial in breaking the stigma around sexuality, particularly if theres a child in the class who has same-sex parents, but leave it at love - pre-pubescent children do not need to know about sex.  Homosexuality, or the homosexual lifestyle (I hate that term because my life is no different to my parents or my straight friends - I go to work, on days off I clean my house, I do my food shopping, and I chill) is not all about sex, homosexuality is about same-sex attraction and love, about a gay male looking for his Prince Charming or a gay female looking for her Princess, just like a straight male looking for his Princess or a straight female looking for her Prince Charming.  Yes, most straight people think homosexuality is synonymous with promiscuity, but thanks to marriage equality that seems to have changed - in fact, I know more straight people who have one night stands than gay people!  All kids need to know is love may look different, but its still love and its beautiful.  A 4yr old doesnt need to know how anyone, gay or straight, is intimate with someone else.  And as for pride in school - maybe in high school, but not any younger!Moving on to gender.  100 genders, really?  An affinity with stars?  What?!  I hope this doesnt get me cancelled and Im prefacing my comments with live and let live - as long as youre happy and not hurting anyone then you do you, I have no issue with you.  But gender identity is the hot topic, and its currently fashionable to be non-binary or to be trans, just like bi- and homosexuality was the fashionable thing about a decade ago when there was a big increase in the number of teens coming out.  I dont think it should be taught in primary and middle school at all.  Young kids play dress up, they let their imaginations run wild and they have fun.  I played with Barbies and when I played house with my friends in primary school/reception (kindergarten for non-UK folks) I was the Dad and I stayed home to play with the baby that the stalk brought.  No one suggested maybe I am trans or non-binary.  And, Im glad they didnt because I ended up confused enough over sexuality when kids started calling me gay, can you imagine what disastrous outcome Id have if Id been told I should choose to be a girl or whatever else I may have an affinity with?  Growing up can be tough, lets not make it harder for kids.  Before the hormones go wild let children keep their innocence, let them believe the stalk brings babies, let them pretend to be a dinosaur or fireman or stay-at-home Dad - pretending doesnt make them any of those things, and if a boy pretends/dresses up as a girl it doesnt make them trans (I tried on my Mums high heels and necklace and Im definitely still male), just like a girl who is a tomboy isnt trans.  The only time I think gender and being trans should be discussed with pre-pubescent kids is if a young child is saying theyre trans, in which case that child should be spoken to away from everyone else, asked if they know what that means and if they do and they really feel that way then support that child individually and privately, it should be on a case-by-case basis.  But, in my opinion (based on experience), most young kids are saying theyre trans because theyve been pushed into believing they are by adults, usually parents who seem to use their kids to make a point or as a fashion accessory because, as I said, being non-binary/trans is fashionable right now.  Regarding high schoolers, perhaps gender could be touched on during sex ed at age 14/15 to let any kids questioning their gender know theyre not abnormal and to let cis kids know transgender people exist, and to also remind kids that there may be things they dont like about their bodies, especially whilst their bodies are changing, but that doesnt make them trans and when they become adults most will outgrow their body dysmorphia, that they dont need puberty blockers or surgery to fix their problem, they need time and to mature.(Continued in replies)",NHS

This is the same when it comes to gender and sex, of course a well accepted biological fact that there are only 2 sexes and 2 genders. However, that goes out the window in the bent minds of the radical Leftists. To them facts dont matter anymore and hang the future consequences of ignoring them in their preference in promoting the lies of progressive ideological nonsense!

745,Regarding bullying - a male person (as is the fashion to call people these days) leapt out from between a SUV and a van in order to cross the road in front of my car. To be clear this was not on a pedestrian crossing.   I had to do an emergency stop.  There was a distance of 10 to 14 feet from the person to the car at standstill.  This male person then started to shout saying that I needed to have my sight tested and started to hit my car very aggressively.  This person was aged 35 -40.  I was an adult female a bit older than the male.  THIS is an example of bullying among adults.  It happens.

754,"Theres a big difference from dont bully this person because they have two mummies or two daddies and this is what a gay relationship is. I always believe education is the key, issues like racism, inequality in general cant just be fixed, they need to be educated out of society, but it has to be done correctly and at the right age. My issue with left and right politics in general is this all or nothing approach. There is a lot of grey areas, with complex issues. Ive always believed in the individuals right to live life how they choose, within the law. However when it comes to trans people in sport, prison systems, use of changing rooms, there has to be a degree of lines drawn. Looking purely at this from a left or right perspective most commonly devoids the subject of any common sense. Its about protecting people, their rights, no matter what side they are. Trans people need their rights protecting but not at the cost of Cis people, and visa versa. Young girls shouldnt be forced to see Male genitals in changing rooms, but trans people shouldnt be shuffled off into out of sight out of mind places. We are all human, should be treated as such and the more people can have constructive convocations without the need to go activist on either side the sooner we can find solutions where everyones righst are respected.",NHS

No one under 13 should be talking about these issues unless its a group of kids dealing with body dysphoria, &amp; that needs to be looked at from a lens of if its being provoked or they/he/she is being persuaded by their surroundings, &amp; what comes from their own internal landscape. Confusing the two can lead to confusing &amp; catastrophic, if not outright cult-ish and abusive behavior. Bullying can happen due to so many aspects, acceptance is one thing, but propagating that a trans woman is the same as a real woman should be left to the adults, at at the very youngest, teenagers... The country is becoming gayer and gayer by the day, statistically--- &amp; I dont mean happy... Nowadays someone can identify as an apple and get away with it. My pronouns are granny Smith, lol. Its absurd. Children should not be groomed into this before they even understand the mechanics of sex &amp; gender....Its outright abusive, IMO, to sexualize children or have them surrounded by adults who are acting in a provacative &amp; sexual manner, displaying kinks, giving kids the choice of being non-binary before they understand the gravity of such a decision due to the ongoing fad. Its great that homosexuals/lesbians/bisexuals, etc, are out of the closet &amp; I dont think they deserve abuse unless they are doing something abusive, such as raping others, using it as an excuse to  be a predator, to get attention, &amp; many of the other horrid things that come with this territory. We should not sacrifice the innocence of our children &amp; confuse them in the name of being open-minded. Limits must be set, &amp; while Ive identified as a libertarian, I must say, many have taken it a bit too far, &amp; I am not even sure I want to be associated with most libertarians anymore, if this is what the majority of them believe. I lean more towards the left than the right, but I think our country needs less division and more common ground. This should be a no-brainer.... Children are malleable &amp; their environment impacts them greatly. If there are children who have issues they should be discussed with the parents, but taking away the rights if the many, to cater to the rights if the ever rising community of LGBTQ+ is absurd. They have been accepted by the masses, &amp; by Hollywood, but not everyone fits that mold, &amp; children shouldnt be expected to cater or conform to the new principles set in this new, ever increasing LGBTQ+ world.

The genotype of an egg cell is XX and the genotype of a sperm cell is XY... The default form of human is the XX genotype which is a female and Y chromosome is the male chromosome... This is the genetic make up of most of us... Now lets talk about exeptions. There is the XYY &amp; XXX chromosomes which are supermales and super females... And there are XXY which is klinefelter and XO which is Turner syndromes.... And intersex people have XX or XY chromosomes ... But due to various developmental conditions they have partially developed genitals of males and females and there are various situations for them..... And intersex people are not half male and half female.. It is just a misconception.... After getting this cleared.... From this we can summerize that there are only 2 genders male and female... And the rest of the genotypes are defect within these 2 genotypes.... Now these people of the LGBTQIA+ community are all mentally sick people.... The human body has a scale of masculinity and feminity..... A person can be a man but be feminine and a person can be a female and be masculine.... These people confuse themselves with it for being enirely different genders... Just because they feel nothing will change... And here we come to the main reason, it is because they feel.. Feelings are entirely controlled by our brain and hormones....it is the reason why women suffer from PMS.... And the brain is an organ which literally changes in structure when subject to different types of environments and stresses for a prolonged period of time.... That is the main reason brainwashing works and why we have terrorists... They are all brainwashed... And another reason is the situation in which we are living, for explaination of this watch the experiment universe 25it will give all your answers to the present day situation and the future that we are going to face..and coming to the main argument that the radical leftist have is  it is their life and their decision and their body and they are not harming anyone agreed then why are we against suicides...it is their body and their life that they are taking with their own hands...you should be promoting it....who are we to interfere....

Sexual harassment was pretty much there even with the presence of this department. Wage Gap is also a problem. So, that means this department proved to be a failure. So, what the reasoning for keeping this worthless ministry? Instead, South Korean women should make their Govt focus on the realities about the failure of the Ministry and force their Govt to create a better Council or Ministry which will actually work with women to bring Gender Equality in South Korea.Also, I blame KDrama too for literally showing women as objects of desire, as weak and fragile. In many KDramas, even if the man mistreats the woman, cheats on her, somehow, they end up together. I mean this type of shows in the name of Drama and Romance are utterly annoying and somehow sends a negative message. Hell, even JDramas and CNDramas are changing, some new shows are trying to show women in positive light while not being male bashing. Animes also are showing women as independent these days. So, KDramas also should change their story. Entertainment influences societies and should be used in positive light.",NHS

And they did it cause of some nonsense shit like i dont know how to explain it but some of them disagree cause of domestic violence. Now i will explain it. It because mistranslation. Cause in English agreement it says domestic violence and in the agreement it says violence in the house which is right translation. And also people use one more thing for it this word and it is violence in the family. Its a mistranslation but people use it. And that means if you are not married or you are in lgbtq community and if you abused by your partner then this agreement contain you too and they says they wanna destroy our family concept and some people against it because of the when woman claim that she was abused or something like that government should give a restraining order based on victim. And the authorities should search for is it true or false accusation. Again it says victim in the agreement but people who against agreement says woman against victim. And they think if woman says anything they will be stand trial without any investigation. And when government abolish Istanbul agreement crime against woman increased. Now they think they are free for to abuse you. And theyre so many famous murder case and man says it to partners i will kill you like this person and no one help you.

It doesnt matter whether you are innocent or not, youll lose your job and suffer for a long time. If you prove that you are not guilty, it doesnt change anything you lost everything already and woman wont be punished for making false accusations. Its horrible yeah but its true theres nothing you can do about it because it is the law system made by feminists. In the history we can learn that when woman gets power, the society will corrupt and fall. Now korean people learning that lesson again from the evil feminists in Korea.

Men and power to me, seem to create a mess all the time, corruption, all the time, and the one with the most evil, which comes to the conclusion, that because men are the most evil is how they get away to brainwashing that the more pure hearted, woman are considered inferior, which has brainwashed many men and unfortunately woman. Don’t be brainwashed anymore. No one is more intelligent than the other, just by gender or race.

1385,"1. Gender Equality Ministry is a grossly negligent translation, likely on purpose given the general tone of this video. It is called 여성가족부, which literally means Women and Family Ministry. This ministry is NOT about equality but rather about issues pertaining to women. Sure, they overlap in some but not the same thing. In fact, only about 25% of its budget is for womens issues, not all of which are for equality.2. This news piece suggests that growing misogyny is the reason behind why people advocate for abolishing this ministry. That is not the case, in fact, inarguably so. Mysogyny has been in steady decline in Korea. Most arguments for abolishing this ministry comes down to the family part, which is much beyond the scope of this video (below*). No one is saying funding to support victims of sexual assault is obsolete.3. Pay gap... this age old moot fallacy. The reason why this looks worse in Korea is because of its toxic work culture where workers are expected work late and men are much more likely to do it than women.4. More than 800 organisations came to protest, yes. This is a highly controversial topic with people on both sides, with more people were for abolishing this ministry. Yoon made this political promise (and possibly won the election) because the support was greater for abolishing. I mean.. lets suppose what this video is implying is correct (i.e. Yoon and Koreans are mysoginistic). Then, there is no way Yoon would win with losing all votes from women, who make up more than 50% of population.(*ineffective policies that has put Korea in the impending demographic doom, reactionary censorship for adolescents, budget being used to fund non-related NGO, abolishing bonus points for those who went to army, etc). At the end of day, more Koreans felt this ministry was promoting toxic feminism rather than true equality. Kind of like this video...

Like i think job requirements should be same for both genders like firefighters and police cause we don’t need representation we need the most skilled people to save people. And Salary and job hiring should be based on skilled not by gender just that your woman and saying u didn’t pick cause i am woman no it’s because u weren’t skilled enough for example my aunt is a hard working person and she earns a lot of money because she is smart and skilled. Like i heard the government is cleaning dirty houses for free only for ‘women’ and gives them money(the money that we give our taxes). The government pay female strippers to stop their job jut most of them say they  quit it and do it again… (our taxes) do u call that equal? It should be both genders if its equal. I find this dumb its kinda like the all black people are good and all white people must be  misogynistic thing going in some places yes some people might be god some people might be misogynistic but not all are same goes for gender not all men are sexual harassers and not all women are kind. For one news star bucks  was giving free coffee event for people who went to the military mostly male so some women were like why are u giving free coffee only for men (its because they did the military service which is not a easy thing and u could die) so they had to stop the event it’s honestly dumb.they should make services for both genders honestly.",NHS

Of course there are women in the society being treated harshly but the government (left and right) in korea are making this to get more votes from division between men and women which i strongly disagree. Its a lot like US where they try to make femenist leftist demonise men and men are not happy about that. More about the Gender Equality Ministry, the reason why korean men are angry at them is because they 1. support femenism that demonises men and creates gender division 2. they put femenist ideology into young kids 3. always talking about gender equality when they are not even forced to serve in the military unlike men 4. they want more money for less work 5. made a law making that there should be equal amounts of men and women at work even if they dont do the work, they are forced to hire equal amounts of women. If the korean leftists didnt make gender division and tries to make a better law about sexual harrasement against women and change military service for men then there wouldnt be people trying to get rid of Gender Equality Ministry since all it does it to create more controversy with so much tax. Hope people doesnt see the one side of the story since this is what bbc is making- demonise men and making women a lesser being since they are not. for sure for the older women like 60s and 70s but what do they do to support older women? they dont do anything and thats why elderly suicides in korea is so high.",NHS

1455,Look at south korea demography and add the fact that man MUST go to military for 2 years and ask yourself who is more discriminated? man that still have their natural roles to fulfill like defending a country and dying in some mud or women that dont have to do anything not even create babies for the future of their own country?,NHS
1456,"Feminists will never be enough, give a finger, they will break off the whole hand. They want privileges, but they offer little from themselves. There are women who actually focus on skills development and dont need an Equality Minister, but those are very few compared to most women.",NHS

1462,"The thing is it isnt the ministry/department of gender equality, its ministry/department women and family so many men see it as a form of reverse sexism. Its like how many men see feminism as sexist or pro women only for having the word for femininity in it. Now perhaps they do have a point. Who knows. But in the case of south korea though, I am pretty sure the women and family department deals with domestic violence and paid leave issues too so it is disturbing at the department closing.",NHS

F&lt;bleep&gt;k, nobody else praising this British State TV for providing exactly what they wanted have done the same for me — either. But thats rendered moot for a supposedly non-propaganda operation.Answer me by satiating the most-basic of needs in [old-school ]Journalism: Otherwise, just like Mr Infantinos speech — this is also a well-timed hatchet-job on the Korean society because the Korean national-teams supporters not just rightfully, but righteously mocked the Āryan national-team after they knocked them out of their self-imposed virtue-signalling competition, back to Munich or divided Berlin or wherever else they can find their perfectly-virtuous utopia.",NHS

1473,"Gender Equality? If that is the thing ministry was supposed to do, they truly have to be abolished. Cause they have done nothing about gender equality issues of Korea. When the mayor of Seoul City was charged for sexually abusing his secretary for years what they do was just busy to cover up the mayors dirty issues. (Because that mayor was from same Party of the ministry members.) And they said they have assisted lots of civil organization tries their best to improve gender equality, but it tuns out that most of the organization did nothing but wasting taxes and that ministry never have track down their activity. It means that they have just pour down all the taxes to nothing but a Girls tea party. (They actually handed out the activity list full of Watching gender issue movie with members, Reading gernder issue novel with members, Eating snacks and teas with gender issue committee things on the parliamentary inspection of the administration 🤣🤣) And most of all, they named themselves as Ministry of Gender Equality but they mentioned nothing about the issues of Mandatory Military Services of Male.

As we have seen in the West, its not just merit based equality and fairness that radical feminists really want, but the complete destruction of existing (patriarchal) institutions, traditional families, morals and norms.

1480,I couldnt beleive such a thing is a problem of kind and calm country of Korea if someone said that to me. Cause I really like Korea. I especially like their tv series standarts. They make small serious. They try new things and have very original ideas. Unlike other countries they make better movies. And in those movies we see how they ignore violence towards women and show equality. And since its a country banned guns I thought they are very modern and peaceful. But look at it. In the year of 2022 their cabinets has nearly zero female parliementer and still governed by traditional sexist ideologies. It is sad. I hope they can fix it.,NHS

Is a perfect society possible by human nature? Then there is no need for religion or country.How can we restore freedom, equality and human rights destroyed by crime? Whats the point of a completely destroyed value recovery?There is only punishment, judgment, death and live within the crime category. Its really low intelligence for me to cry that the suspect in sex crimes ignored gender equality. In the world of evil, do not condemn gender discrimination, but run to the court immediately to seek retribution, justice, and compensationI wasnt interested in social pathology, but I found that more than the  half had a masculine appearance when I looked at women who fell into feminism. Their words and actions are more direct, unconventional, and radical than men. Did God set up a synopsis for women to evolve like that? A woman speaks and acts like a man, overwhelming a man like reed (Korean young men who are becoming feminized by beautiful-looking female teachers who dominate 80 percent of the societys teaching profession, or young Koreans who are starting to be criticized by foreign countries for being feminine). Is this really the logic of a normal society?Korea, where women become deformed lady (With Phallus  growing slowly) and overwhelm men(with  phallus away), is not only vulnerable to foreign aggression, but will also be doomed. The two organisms that have evolved into a complementary relationship must be guaranteed the right and pursuit of happiness, but this must also be a complementary relationshipNon-complementary relationships do not exist in nature.Goodbye ^^",NHS

The word women are reeds means, to put it right, women often betray as if they eat breakfast everyday.Dont get too excited. That organization that asks female employees to wash towels is a very rare case in Korea. It is a great illusion to think that all social organizations are like that. If the companys department moves, does the woman carry heavy things when they have to moves all of all the office supplies? If employees need to clean up, who needs to clean the office and toilet floors? Korean men do itIn any country , Is there a distinction between men and women in who commits evil? This video only lists unconventional and special criminal acts. But seeing the way that the political woman spoke, she might have been neglected by her fellow men because of her a hasty and inconsiderate personality. Korean Women politicians have rarely been so disliked by men and are working well with fellow menIn Korea, if a man makes a bad joke or unreasonable demands on a woman, he often is immediately sued, and men avoid fighting with women because they are afraid.

Men commit suicide 10 times more than women, get promoted two years later, and the highest-income medical and toothpaste departments are forced to hire twice as many women. In the case of teachers, a high-income occupation, the proportion of women is more than 80%, but they say that it is desirable and that more women in science and engineering should be selected. Although less than half the number of women studying science is mandated to be employed equally.

In 2020 alone, out of total external budget of over US$150 Million (most of it, external entity payment),  15% of its amount was unaccounted for (Roughly US$22 Million), and it was only revealed via audit committee conducting investigations.  For some outside entities, they were paid for activities and services that were never performed or cancelled.  In July of 2020, over 100,000 citizens signed petition for the closure of GEM.  Most of the issues can be handled by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of Labor.

So, the birth rate is 0.75 get will to 0.5 soon. Korean men start to marry many white women in Eastern Europe(Russia, Ukraine, Hungary and Poland, and American, west European ladies)and Japanese ladies. This is because these white women and Japanese women know that young Korean men are willing to sacrifice for women and their families and the men went to the army for her country. I think Korean men are more pitiful.Korea is the best country in that damm Asia for women to live in.I think that marrying a white woman or a Japanese woman by young Korean men will make Korean society brighter and more make it a society for women.  Korean men are pitiful.All foreigners and even Koreans have a wacky understanding of why the birth rate is falling. The truth is that Korean men are avoiding marriage With Korean women. YouTube videos show the trend of marrying white women or Japanese women. How could that be?---&gt; Korean men are afraid to support Korean women in their entire lives. In other words, just fierce competition for survival is not the main cause of the low birth rateI think Korean young women should go to the military.

Feminism, the belief in social, economic, and political equality of the sexes.Those saying if you want equality, do physical stuff and all, need to realize that the demand is equality in opportunity. Physically and biologically men and women have different construction. Their structures are not similar. Theres a huge difference in most of the physical aspect. Hence, the demand is for equality in opportunities, skills, treatment, respect, etc.2. In recent years, a huge chunk of the world population is facing setbacks in terms of women empowerment or equality including developed and undeveloped nations alike. So, pointing fingers at each other in the comment section is really useless. Everyone is trying to defend their nations while offending others. Other than a few exceptions, females and the minority groups are struggling to make ends meet. Also, this by no means justify the small groups of women using these opportunities for crimes as well.3. We all admire countries mostly from the tip of the iceberg (as in only the good things come out). The 3/4 th part under the sea level stays invisible or unspoken. Hence, it is partly our fault for putting different countries on pedestal or bringing them down.4. Women being safe in any country does not equate to equality. It is not equal to having same treatment. A female or person in minority can still be treated unfairly despite being safe. Giving respect and treating someone as helpless are two different things. Lets not mix them up.",NHS

Especially the girl who got raped and the family called her shameful. I can’t say anything for the pay gap between men and women cuz in the US men work way more hours and women tend to go in less paying jobs so since idk the case for SK I can’t say much. But I did watch a a video last year or 2 that feminism and anti feminism was on the raise there. And in america I’m on the anti feminism side. Also the men who were rooting for the president, it was a lot of them and a lot Korean men I’ve met were nice and caring so seeing all those men their cheering on a man who possibility says bad things, doesn’t seem right.

1921,"This report is despicably biased. The very department that will be abolished in Korea is mainly blamed for its political agenda with Liberal Party. its shamless people in the video play victim. Even though this video says the name of the department is Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, the actual literal translaction is Ministry of Women and Family. It wants to promote women and has nothing to do with Eqaulity. Anyhow, the agency &amp; the Liberal Party(Blue color <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxH2ELUTu_4&amp;t=2m34s"">2:34</a>) has been called out for scrutiny and illegal and michiveous activity for more than a decade. It has supporters and ministers that Embezzle money from the Fund for Comfort Women(from Japanese occupation) for lavish lifestyle, wasting $1.8 Billion dollar worth of government fund for decorating the Ministry building, coaching rape victims causing mistrial/bad cases and making the rape victims helpess, enacting on &amp; off-line censorship, publcly labeling all men potential buyer-for-sex, literally slaming door on sexual harassment victim and calling police on her turning her away from the Ministry building, hiring cyber warriors making false comments and trying to control public debate/opinion, shutting down sexual assault investigation on political party members, providing goverment funding  for radical feminists, hiring radical feminists as government employees creating male-shaming propagandas, forcing gender-sensitivity training on all government agency &amp; public companies(including Samsung &amp; Hyundai) with biased material full of controversal propaganda messagers, strong-arming and intimidating other government agencies &amp; department publicly villifying them, pressuring Department of Education to teach children with feminist biased agenda brainwashing boys, and so on.Feminists activity has wide spectrum and develop differently in each contry. Feminism in Scadinavian contries shows maturity and draws public consensus. But Feminism in Korea is radical and fraudilent and is not what you know of from different cotries. This is not just fight for equality &amp; human rights as in whats going on in Iran. I encourage and support that everyone(men &amp; women) do what they want to do as long as they work for it. You want to be a doctor? Then go to med school. It has no gender quota and in fact more women attend med schools then men do. I am not saying Korean society is perfect but it is highly competitive and men takes risks and sometimes the risks pay off and move up faster. Park JiHyun(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxH2ELUTu_4&amp;t=2m15s"">2:15</a>) who plays victim is a person who has very record of 2 mos of Journalist, supposedly she was part of investive journalism ever since and she held various titles as co-chair to some politically-motivated groups(in Korea there are a lot of political research group that has vauge and/or ambiguous purpose. they are nothing like Think Tank organizations in USA). There have been young politicians as early as in twenties but most of them shows they are capable and proved their excellency either by winning local elections to be a senator or pushing for drafting and enacting legislative bills. But she has done nothing concrete and all she does is talk and blog. Even the Liberal party members questions her ability and would rougly describe her as parachute politician.

1923,"We need to understand the full story that BBC didn’t bother to cover. Korea has pay gap between genders and there are less women in the workforce. There are still older generations looking down on women and it’s up to new generation to fix it. Thankfully those cultures are dying in the younger generation. And the idea of male superiority is repulsed by most of the young people. These male-dominant cultures must be eliminated, but NOT through this ministry. This ministry is actually called “ministry of woman” in Korean and this ministry does NOT work for gender equality. With a massive funding from the government, their output has been very minimum. And that female politician you saw in the video was sadly elected as a puppet of her party to represent “women” in the time of a major election. This means that she was “hired” by her party simply because she was a woman, not because of her qualifications. Since she didn’t have any experience and education related to any policy making and her suggestions and claims brought up controversies in and out of her party. She was looked down not because she was a female, but more because she was young (yes, there is also another culture looking down on young people) and didn’t know what she was doing in her field. The Korean government is not trying to stop the policy of gender equality, but rather reform the ministry and have the other ministries to take the jobs and actually get the jobs done. This ministry came up with the women-only parking lots (and parking lots are always scarce in Korea) and only defend the victims only if they are biologically women. Of course then people will be angry because males can be victims too. In Korea there was a law saying that only women can be victims of the rape until very recently. They described every man as “potential rapist” and the former minister publicly described men as “dogs to guard the country”(in the situation where only males serve in the mandatory military service for 2 years in Korea). The people want to reform that ministry. Shouting gender equality does not mean that they are doing their job diligently.",NHS

1972,"Women’s rights in Korea, I will have to say is a highly volatile matter, and differs by generation. This video is absolutely poorly made, and try to fit the “cultural liberal” agenda to S.Korea.My parents’ generation and above, it is a serious issue. My mum worked in NPS, National Pension Service and sexism was something she had to fight for her life. Now she says otherwise, that most interns and recruits are women and she worries that soon the society will turn into reverse of what she experience. Sexism, is an issue that young man and old woman suffers in Korea.Now, the reason why this video is poorly made, is that this video is based on a politician named 박지현, Park Ji-hyeon, a democrat who were disliked by both democrats and PPP. I am slightly biased as I am a member of the democratic party, but she was a type of person who tried to implement identity politics to Korea. Democrats fought hard to kick her out(she was an acting party leader) and now she goes around presses and utilise her identity politics to shake up democratic party of Korea. Her only career was to found the sexual grooming scheme, and she did a brilliant job on that. On the question whether Korea is safe for women or not, I think it is the most safe place on this planet, thus young women enjoy many privileges such as not enlisting to military services and there is no benefit of doing military services as it is “sexist institution”, that she claims.I hate using the word west, as Korea is a integral part of the west too, but there is no way that western feminism will fit in Korea, as Korea has somewhat equal rights by giving disadvantage to both sex.

But the problem is that for the last 15 years the ministry has done nothing but causing gender conflict and wasting its buget. For example one third of the ministrys buget is used on taking care of women in need and making a applcation that women can use to call for help when needed. But the applcation does not work well and it taking a long time for women to get the help she needs. The ministry of women and family has also made some changes in the police exam and made the exam easier for women. this was a big news to the young  in korea because young koreans were in a big unimployment and making it easier for a woman was not welecomed. Men didnt like it because it was unfair and women didnt like it because after allowing weak women to work as a policewomen many policewomen lost trust by the people, both female and male. (Also after this 2 policemwomen who were dispatched to a crime sence ran away from the criminal because they were scared). In 2021 the ministry of women and family made a new sex crime prevention education video. In the video a woman comes out and says men are potential criminals(for real) and men should not be angry for being treated like one. Men have to show that he is not a criminal before going near a women. This made Korean men furious and the ministry crossed the rubicon. This is why the ministry of women and family is getting abolished. it has not helped women in need made half of the country furious. the ministry lost its reason to stay as a ministry of the korean government.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92kbyBO4lHE"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92kbyBO4lHE</a><a href=""https://m.mt.co.kr/renew/view.html?no=2021112406342186002&amp;type=outlink&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com"">https://m.mt.co.kr/renew/view.html?no=2021112406342186002&amp;type=outlink&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com</a>",NHS

My grandparents generation was during the Korean war, and SK was so poor, even Africa sent donations to us. Basically, for their generation Korea was a 3rd-world country. (Kinda hard to think about gender equality when you and your family is literally starving to death, dont you think?)And then during the Miracle on Han-river Korea grew rapidly, becoming something of a 1st-world country in 50 years somewhere between my parents generation and mine. (Just imagine how big the conflicts between generations are.)The point is, that a lot of foreigners like to throw shit at us for being backwards at some aspects and expects us to be just like the other developed countries. Well let me get this straight. We didnt get to have time for a smooth transition like you guys. Yeah, smooth.

Ive been living in Korea for a long time now and Ive seen how the feminist movement is directly attached to politics and how its often used as a scapegoat to justify certain actions and garner empathy. The organization they mention is actually the women and family organization not gender equality so theres a bit of a mistranslation there which is wildly misleading.

Yo guys, if in America their shady characters are born from wealthy families, same clubs, grad from same universities I feel like in Korea its that one shady born again Christian that teaches men are top of women and for Japan to be forgiven it should be that way, their women be married to their men... Hmmm its a conspiracy but try to find about it, glad Manny Pacquiao and other characters whove been brainwashed or have those mega church relations arent in top Philippine government positions. Its way darker because those people can invoke moral high ground and make people who are not followers and part of their org be viewed with disgust as Hitler did.Heres my own view tho: Western beliefs on responsibility and leadership lean towards individualism, but on Asian beliefs on responsibility is on society as a whole, not just on your self and family/household, its like more influenced by Confucianism by your position in society? patriarchy isnt bad at all but also it should be that Women be given equal opportunity but in positions and income its a different game because those are responsibility topic, like being a father in taking care of the whole family, its a heavy responsibility. But its good that women be in more workforce only that the trade off is a lot wont keep their positions at 30, its sad and hard for women to not have relationships/have children that old. Well some of their collectivist views are inspired by aristocracy which is kind of meh, just as some hate that India still has the caste system which is kind of outdated but some are practical like for marriage as some psychologist know already that women tend to marry those who will be good to them, provide and are somewhat near their attractiveness level. Now it is not that proper masculinity is bad, its that we know responsibilities and there are some line to not cross or else you wanna get beaten the crap out of you. Dominance hierarchy is real, its part of us as animals, mammals and cousins to chimps and in men we are often inclined to dominate somewhere but we also keep in our mind to be responsible, be able to control our emotions (also remember how Greeks viewed guys who have small dong as having self control), be dangerous yet able to control it (like to keep peace, be able to know how to use a sword at right time/situation but also sheath it). Now there are many weak men and also a lot make more weak men, who are bellow dominance hierarchy but just got lucky to be at the top (money, position etc),  look at how they treat women (also its those who are weakling or failures in competence hierarchy that rape women and young men).Lastly, please dont politicize every freaking thing👌Edit: HEY HEY HEY, look as I said its okay that women enter the work force as it is correlated somehow to more prosperous income (please watch from Jordan B Peterson) but look, look many Korean women doesnt take part much in other areas anymore like in farms its then that born again church got other nationalities to do those work like... see?? also in Japan a lot of Japanese know that a lot of foreigners do work in their country that they dont wanna do.

I truly agree on the original purpose of making this ministry 20 year ago and We still need to go foward more for the true equality but the function of this department has to be replaced or improved by another way . The original purpose of this department has been distorted by racial femisit groups and making only strange policy like women only parking space in some public space or subsidizing only women in thier young age for renting house.  When it comes to the physical difference in between, Korean man is always ready to support and to be a little incovinient But , those are nothing to do with gender equality. and there are even much more important value than Gender euquality like protecting my country. If they are really purusing gender euquality, they should vaule more their soldiers who spend 2year in military service in thir most valueable young ages,  rather than scorning or brining into derisionOne of the main reason of regim change in the presidential election this year was becuase of this ineuqality that felt by young man in Korea. I agree on that the Gender Equality issue was bad in Korea and quite majority part of it was comming from the cultural backgorund  and the women who spend their life before year 2000 had suffered this cultural discrimination . but any how, still it is not enough but Korean society has been changed alot.

Of course they have done important work for some victims as showcased here; but those cases are few, and more resources have been put towards pushing job quotas, producing unproven information to garner support for more radical feminism, and political favours for those close to powerful officials. This issue is of course complicated by the fact that many Koreans are still very sexist and support the removal of the ministry for sexist reasons; however, although this video may depict it as such, that is not the full story at all.

In truth, the former Moon government had used the women to garner the more voting block instead of righting many deep rooted discrimation against women.  Nevertheless,  Korea has improved a lot to treat women fairly and better.   In my opinion, it is not a issue of discrimination against women, but, rather it is the deeply rooted societal disease.  In fact,, It was shocking moment to see the media outlets(papers or air), politicians, judges, prosecutors, news anchors,  guests at news desks, and seemingly senseless crowds(many of them are sympathizing with brutal North Korean dictator or spies, or headless followers), pointing fingers at the former president 박근혜 to criticize, find faults with her.  Maliciously attacking her with fabricated stories, dirty words, framing her as witchcraft, sexually immoral, murderer(세월호사건).  It was unbelievable how this could happen in S. Korea who boasts of its developments.  So, my conclusion is the womens issue are not just their only issue.  It looks like S. Korean society is rotting morally, politically.  And, the rule of laws have been undermined by judges( who twisted laws to please those Moon(former presidents officials sympathizing with the brutal and beastly NorthKorean dictator) and to save themselves.  It was mind-boggling to see, hear how they sent the former president 박근혜 with 30 years prison sentencing and impeached her of her presidency with nothing more than outright nonsense.  So, you cannot see womens  issues as only one case in Korea,  it is a merely one of many diseases  in Korean society...  Nontheless, one thing I want to leave with is S. Korea has improved greatly to treat women respectfully fairly.  In my opinion, those people mistreating women are having personal issues.  In general, Korean men treat women respectively well and you can see it in countless families...  and I believe more and more will do so as the rule of laws are becoming well received over all aspects of society....",NHS

2343,"Let me chip in as a Korean MALE.  Gender Equality Ministry is probably the least popular government agency in Korea.  You might think only men dislike it, but a lot of women think it is biased too.  The main group that supports it vocally are the diehard feminists.  So why is this ministry so unpopular?  This agency has been responsible for some EXTREMELY controversial legislations in the name of championing womens causes.  For instance, in Korea, if a woman claims a man raped her and the man cant prove that he didnt, then he is pretty much convicted on the strength of her testimony alone--i.e., he is presumed guilty till proven innocent.  If a man is found hiring a prostitute, he is usually fined, and a pimp who manages prostitutes will certainly go to jail if he is caight, but the prostitute herself will often get off with a warning.  Not only that, if a prostitute wants to leave her profession the government will provide her with severance pay for months because they assume that she was forced to sex work by poverty even though everybody knows that the majority of Korean prostitutes are not impoverished at all and make way more money than most people.  Korean companies also must offer a period sick day so that a woman can take 1 day off each month when she is having her period.  But a huge number women will take this sick day only on Fridays or Mondays, basically taking advantage of it to extend a weekend.  Female police officers are not required to meet a high physical fitness standard as men are, and Korean policewomen have been heavily criticized for failing to arrest criminals or even FLEEING a crime scene and leaving a victim to be murdered by a violent intruder.  And Korean men are obligated to serve in the military for 2 years, but when the government tried to reward them by giving ex-soldiers extra points in certain job applications, the legislation had to be scrapped due to fierce opposition.  Guess which organization was behind every one of these situations?  The one mentioned in this news clip.  And thats why a lot of Koreans believe it has basically become an interest group, not a government body.There is a growing sentiment among young Korean men that women are in fact doing better than them socially and financially, but the government will bend over backward to protect womens rights while neglecting mens.  Am I saying that these men are entirely correct?  NO.  But I am saying this little news clip fails to give an accurate background for this controversy.

It goes back to the issue of comfort women, who were forced into prostitution by Imperial Japan with the cooperation of many Koreans who did Japans dirty work.

Half of South Korean men support anti-feminism and many men pay to anti-feminist groups, so they continue to build up their power by making huge amounts of money.
Korea used to have serious male supremacy in the past, and the number of young women is less than that of young men right now. A large number of men are unable to get married because of that. Women have more power then men in the love market. This is the reason that 2030 young men hate 2030 young women in Korea. Korean men want a male-dominant society like the old generation, but they have less power in love market.
In India, many young men are unable to get married due to same reason. so they are trying to suppress women because of it like korea men.
India and Korea men have same reason. they can not marry, so they hate women. simply, there are too many INCEL (Involuntary Celibate) in korea and india. this argument is supported by the number of women being killed or assaulted in Korea when women try to end their relationship.

2406,"[rant begins] Ok BBC, you talk like as if gender roles are bad? The reason gender roles exist is because men and women excel in different things to each other.  Women are better at taking care of the children and running a family at home than the vast majority of most men. While the vast majority of men excel at going to work and providing the family they have back at home and protect the family. Men are physically superior to women that is fact. 99.9% of men are in the work force for constructing, manufacturing, ship building, bricklaying, infrastructure building and general labour. 99.9% of women are in the banking, accounting, education/teaching, healthcare/nursing, business management and general finance. But all the things I’ve just mentioned that men dominate in the labour sectors, the vast majority of women actively avoid getting those types of jobs because it’s not attractive to them and they know they would struggle at it and because they know they are not cut out for it but demand equal pay regardless simply because their are women and for some reason that gives them the right to do that. No it doesn’t. It’s extremely narcissistic and that probably explains why South Koreans like everybody else has heard you’re alt-left bullshite and told you to fuck off. I mean you literally admit IN THE VIDEO that they have a fuckin gender equality department/ministry.

And the fine for that is literally nothing. How do you think it’d be in small companies?😅3.

The Asian people, as a whole, are one backward conservative people, again, regardless what ethnic, what educational level they have, or what regional group youre talking about. And Ive lived in the US, being around mostly White people (of European descent) for close to 45 years, so I also know Whites and Westerners ARENT that much better, either; theyre just more discrete/clever about their sexism, narcissism, and patriarchal BS. And to mask those primitive norms, traditions, beliefs, and practices, for example, Whites and Westerners (at least the more liberal folks) like to pass a lot of laws for public consumption; but deep down, however, mainstream Conservative, religious Whites best EPITOMIZE what Westerners and White people really are, what they believe in, what they cherish the most, on these issues. And it is NOT difficult to understand why, on the whole, Whites/Europeans are also backward, primitive, patriarchal, and sexist:  of the era in society that Conservative, religious Whites yearn to return to, White people and, in particular, White men, controlled at least 99% of all powerful positions in society: in politics, in law, in education, in economic activities, etc. And that is NOT a generalization: go look at the OLD PICTURES (1950s and earlier decades and centuries) of the American government (pictures of judges, politicians, presidents, ambassadors, lawyers, teachers/professors, business elites etc.).That is, deep down, Whites and Westerners/Europeans are just as bad as Asians.Again, the only difference is, Asians would NOT pass laws to publicly deal with those Cave Man, conservative, sexist, narcissistic, ugly, and patriarchal BS (if they could get away with not doing so; and very few Asian nations have such laws, not in South Korea, not in Japan, not in China). Instead, Asians would simply tell you, in a straight face &amp; with irreverence (like Muslims do it when it comes to their Bronze Age values as they apply to women):  ----- We are doing these FOR women... because we cherish and love them... we love OUR women more than you ignorant foreigners love yours... look at the horrible things you make your women do; we love our women so much, we dont do bad things to them or let them do bad things to themselves, like you people; whatever we do, its all for our womens good...",NHS
2509,GENDER EQUALITY MINISTRY😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,NHS
2510,Do not generalize a country by watching just one video clip. Abolishing the ministry doesnt mean Korea no longer cares womans right. After this change every ministry will have a department to cover gender equality. Currently in Korea many people think that The Gender Equality Ministry is ineffective and biased. Even some women say that the Ministry should be abolished. I am very disappointed cause BBC shows the truth very partially. That young female politician was strategically chosen by the Democratic Party not by a vote to get attention from young generation and to make them think the Democratic Party cares young generation but the truth is that nobody thinks she represents young generation. The reason that the Democratic Party chose her is that she is young and female not becaue she has expertise and experience.It is really regretful that BBC is totally biased and doesnt show all facts.

The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family supports single mothers, victims of sexual violence, victims of domestic violence, teenagers who do not attend school, and teenagers in need. There is an institution that does such work in each region of Korea, and I have received help from that institution. And the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family studies gender discrimination. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family is not an institution that wastes taxes by doing unnecessary work. 2. There have been many false rumors about the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family in Korea since the 2000s. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family banned certain biscuits because they resembled womens genitals. The employees of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family embezzled the budget and bought luxury goods for themselves. It turned out to be a fabricated rumor, but some people still believe it. 3. The claim that There are many anti-feminists in Korea because Korean feminists are shallow unlike feminists in other countries is not true. Anti-feminists in Korea attack people who talk about glass ceilings or violence against women. Last year, the Seoul Metropolitan Government provided education for all public officials saying, You should not sexually harass other employees. As a result, the city was attacked by Korean anti-feminists. Korean anti-feminists argued that the education was wrong and extreme feminism.

2599,"This is ridiculous.I understand that from the perspective of foreign media, Korean politics is full of mysteries they cannot understand, but this news report is seriously biased in favor of Korean radical feminists.First of all, the biggest reason why radical feminism is being criticized in Korea is not because it somehow works against men-centered tradition in Korea. It’s because it is actively trying to distort and change the Korean law so that women are given privileges in court against men for the sole reason of being women. Radical feminists have been already successful in their attempt to some degree and now it’s a common knowledge that Korean law enables women to make any man into a sex offender. Think of why social justice warriors and political correctness is being a problem in the west. Korean radical feminism is using the same tactic to corrupt the Korean law.Current Korean President, Yoon Seok-Yeol, used to be the prosecutor general before becoming a president. As a seasoned veteran in the field of law, he was supported by citizens unhappy with previous administration actively supporting liberal extremist groups messing with the law without due process. Radical feminists were one of such groups. But this video portrays his action as motivated by some weird and mysterious concept of collective male pride. He’s not doing it as a representative of Korean men; he’s doing it as a representative of Korean law.I have many more to point out about this video, but obviously I can’t possibly explain all that in this small space designated for comment. So I will point out just one more.The 26 year old lady opening the video with a narration is Park Jihyeon. BBC portrays her as an extraordinarily competent politician who gained leadership position by merit, but this can’t be farther away from the truth.Before her appointment as a co-chairperson of emergency response committee of the liberal opposition party, she had no career and no track record as a politician whatsoever. The only one activity we know she did is ‘cooperation’ in investigation of a very well-known online sex crime case in Korea. That’s it. Nothing more and nothing less. On top of that, she constantly embarrassed herself in public by making very un-educated comments about political issues including but not limited to economic and environmental ones. So it’s perfectly natural that her older colleagues dismissed her opinions about issues other than sex crimes.Now then, you might wonder why such a woman was appointed to such an important position. Long story short, she was appointed by an influential but also highly controversial political known as Lee Jae-Myeong to attract votes from radical feminists. Yes, that is the degree of influence radical feminists have in Korea right now: more than enough for an extremely underqualified woman to gain a leadership position in the biggest liberal party in Korea. Of course, a lot of young men were unhappy about this. Men her age are getting their first jobs, but she gained a political leadership position without any qualification like a breeze. Does this sound like misogyny to you people?Plus, I cannot remember exact name of the statistical dataset, but there was a statistical research done by an international institution about women’s rights in many countries. It had many interesting results, one of which was about actual number of criminal cases against women and women’s perceived likelihood of crimes against women. Very surprisingly, Korea ranked the lowest in the actual number of criminal cases against women, and the highest in women’s perceived likelihood of said crimes.This statistical results can be supported further by survey results in Korea. Radical feminists often assert that young Korean men in 20s and 30s are the most misogynistic population in Korea, but when you survey them along with their female counterpart, survey results show that there is little to no difference between men and women in those age groups on many gender equality issues. The single gender equality issue where men and women showed any difference was about whether they support feminism. Despite their similar responses to other issues, on the issue of feminism, men showed extremely negative responses and women showed moderate to positive responses. These are the same men who showed little to no difference from their female counterpart in their responses to other gender equality issues like gender pay gap, etc.===================Korean politics is weird. Even for someone who spent decades in that place like myself have hard time understanding what’s going on in politics. I even read that news reporters from foreign media have hard time explaining the behaviors of Korean political parties because they do not follow their own ideologies (conservatives not actively supporting, or even working against businessmen, liberals not actively supporting, or even working against rights of minority groups).This is such a sad state of affairs, because even if you feel doubtful about my criticism that BBC is biased in this news report, I cannot provide any advice other than that you have to learn Korean language and go live in Korea for a few years to verify.I just hope that western media do not become yet another useful pawn of radical liberal groups in Korea to corrupt Korean law in their favor.",NHS

2633,"As a Korean American who grew up and worked professionally in both South Korea and the United States Im pretty sure I have a more close up view about this issue than BBC News. The situation is not that Korean men are evil toward women but the result of western influence over individual sovereignty becoming the predominant mindset of the younger Korean population rather than the ideas of Korean Confucianism which prioritized social hierarchy and relationships as the basis pillar for a stable society. For hundreds of years the state of Korea had to depend on strict division of labor (or rather duty) that best enabled the state to survive against neighboring superpower countries (the Chinese, Mongols, Japanese) that continually threatened to and did invade Korea. The recent prosperity, luxury, and freedom that enable Korean individuals to now live their entire lives pursuing their own individual happiness (as a result of US military protection) rather than make sacrifices for the state (and in the case of the sexes, the raising and rearing of children) is a phenomenon that has never existed on the peninsula (and is also one perpetuated by the west with their promotion of consumerism and self determination). The vast majority of the Korean population especially the older ones know that the younger generations pursuit of their own individual happiness at the cost of having kids and raising a new generation is a direct and serious threat to the countrys survival. Korea has one of the lowest birth rates in the world and this gender issue is inherently tied into it. The fight for equal pay for men and women and the demand for equality everywhere in everything is ruining the social hierarchy and relationship between the sexes described in Korean Confucianism that enable for a society to be stable and the country to survive (namely birthing new children, raising them, and creating a new capable next generation). Men get higher pay in Korea than women not because men are evil and want women to suffer but the country needs women to GET MARRIED AND HAVE CHILDREN for the state to guarantee its future! Men also go through a few years of mandatory military service because South Korea has an existential threat right across its northern border. The sacrifices are demanded on both men and women for the sake of the countrys survival. It may seem to some people that women in Korea got the shorter end of the stick when it came to making sacrifices but these sacrifices among the sexes are NOT ANY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD! In fact the curse of women having to give birth and raise children and men having to perform laborious tasks is mentioned as the punishment God gave to the first persons since creation namely Adam and Eve in the story of genesis in the Old Testament. This is a timeless and universal issue!That is not to say that I think the woman whose story was shared here do not have valid grievances. Her having to wash towels for men as a professional working adult is sexual harassment and discrimination and it says in the video that the court recognized it for what it is and called it out. However, the basis for the occurrence of such an episode is not that Korean men are evil and want women to do all the menial tasks but rather the influence of Korean Confucianism that delegated women to do household/domestic chores which was the same mindset not in just Korea but in ALL CIVILIZATIONS THAT HAVE EVER EXISTED. As for the betrayal she experienced while she was a student, I heavily sympathize for the trauma it had on her. However, myself who is a young male adult and intimately familiar with the dating culture in both the West and the East, I firmly believe there is ALWAYS two sides to a story and feel more details need to be shared to determine whether the tragedy she suffered was a product of a twisted cultural norm or rather a consequence of poor individual choices and a lack of personal responsibility on BOTH SIDES. Stories of inappropriate behavior from teachers is not unique to Korea and I think its unfair for it be seen as a Korean misogynistic issue. As for the young Korean woman who is a government and was threatened with an attack with acid on her face, I sympathize for her and I admire her bravery but it is also necessary to be mindful that ALL public officials are threatened with violence with whatever twisted agenda some crazy people can think up. The situation is that she is an incredibly young person thrust into a position that requires a lot of mental endurance and worldly wisdom that a person attains through his/her years. Her feeling like she gets pushed aside from other government issues and is relegated to a small niche of political activism is NOT because she is a girl! It is because she is incredibly young and does not have enough wisdom behind her years to understand the extreme complexities behind problems that haunt the Korean government. I hope what I say here gives more clarification to people who are interested and serious in getting to learn more about Korea. I dont think BBC news did a bad job the feedbacks I saw the comment section call for additional clarification. I am rather fearful of the consequence this video has on the perception of others who do not have a concrete insight into the gender issue that exists in Korea. There is no good and bad people. Only people who are just trying to survive and ensure the survival of their society.",NHS

Whenever there is a inequality debate in Korea, men seem to bring the mandatory military service. So, instead of attacking women why dont you blame the government for this. Or, have you ever raised your voice for the women who voluntarily serve in the Korean military and are sexually harassed and raped by Korean military men. Have you raised your voice against those women who killed themselves because of these systematic violence in the military? Im thinking never. Right? Because why would you do that? Rape happens, thats alright, what happens in the military stays in the military. For those who dont know, search women in Korean military vice. You would see how Korean women are treated in the military.Reading the comments, many have said its actually the corruption. If it really is, why not investigate those corrupted people, seize their property and put then in jail instead of making this an excuse to overthrow a whole agency that helps women. Inspite of corruption, this video clearly shows that many women got necessary help. Just because some higher officials are corrupt doesnt mean everyone working there is corrupt. There should be proper investigation and things should be reformed not abolishing a whole organization. Because corruption exists everywhere. But a whole institution or organization is not shut down.

so a lot of anti-feminist mens are here and writing comments. :)
The head of the anti-feminist group they belong to is a man who assaulted and cheated on his wife, and the wife is a typical conservative family who cries anti-feminism while being beaten by her husband.
Half of South Korean men support anti-feminism and many men pay the organization, so they continue to build up their power by making huge amounts of money.

In Korea, there was an incident which some 20s men caught the weaknesses of many women, including minors, and made them sex slaves and filmed videos. Hundreds of thousands of men watched and enjoyed it and paid for men in their 20s who sexually enslaved women.
Many women were angry at the incident, but many men, including the anti-feminist group, accused the women of being prostitutes. Just because they had a history of posting sexy photos.
Victim women have even attempted suicide, but anti-feminist men insisted sex crimes are womens fault like always they did.
At that time, Park Ji-hyun in this BBC video was on the side of the victims and kept speaking and helping them.
She must be the enemy of anti-feminist men.
Just by talking about womens rights in Korea, she becomes a public enemy.
Korea used to have serious male supremacy in the past, and the number of young women is less than that of young men right now. A large number of men are unable to get married because of that. Women have more power then men n in the love market. it is reason that young men have come to hate young women.In India, many young men are unable to get married due to same reason. so they are trying to suppress women because of it.India and Korea men have same reason. they can not marry, so they hate women. simply, there are too many INCEL (Involuntary Celibate) in korea and india. this argument is supported by the number of women being killed or assaulted in Korea when women try to end their relationship.

We Korean men are not against women, we do not practice misogyny. All of us agree that such a ministry to protect womens rights and support them is absolutely necessary in our nation. We also understand Korean politicians contribute greatly against womens rights, such as prohibition of abortion, and gender inequality.However, the said ministry has done very little to accomplish its intended goal and purpose. They spend billions of our tax on projects that do not show any progress, they have projected men as sexual offenders, they have pushed for ridiculous policy such as banning a biscuit for looking like female genital (thank you for pointing out this to be a rumor, I wasnt aware), they waste so much money and energy when not in use, promoting activities that rather promotes gender inequality against men in military service, who are required to serve in the military for 2 years. The list goes on...I do not have exact statistics (as the said ministry refuses to reveal it in the first place), but we know that they spend too much to show their actual progress. Most believe money is the biggest part of their agenda and their expansion and campaign revolves solely on money, money and money.Also, we are not abolishing the said ministry, but will be merged in to existing department within the government, so that the support for women and their rights are provided throughout, so that the agenda if protecting women is on par as intended.I vouch for womens right, I condemn actions against women across the board. However, abolishing the said ministry is definitely a needed solution so that they:- stop wasting and spending so much energy and money on very little progress- do not misrepresent feminism- do not misrepresent Korean men as sexual offenders- actually serve the purpose they are intended to serveUnderstand once again, I emphasis I do not support misogyny and condemn actions against womens rights, but this ministry in the name of defending women has deviated too much for greed, money and power, rather than serving its intended purpose.

But is actually creating many destroying movements(starting from planting teachers and providing materials in effort to plant extremest feminist ideas in elementary schools.. and on and on...). Plus, a cash cow using tax money in lavish refurnishing of the building or leisure activities of members.Whats actually happening is Korea finds that womens rights in the country has improved to a fair point compared to when the ministry was established. Therefore, we see it as a time to move on to CREATING a Gender Equality Ministry(which would be 성평등부) that goes with its literal name, not the misleading+corrupted Ministry for Women and Families(여성가족부).Besides, the first provoking sample of the lady doing chores for her co-workers was a shock to the Korean society and created a big stir. Because we thought it was f**d up. Not because Korea is headed backwards.The young politician in the centre of this video... what can I say. Im sorry, but she is a joke. She was chosen as a puppet, and showed nothing more  If she didnt know that, its heartbreaking but guess she is incapable of seeing things. (Oh, she was accused for abusing her staff not long after she officially debuted.

Also the ministry has been showing behaviors that supported women superiority over men, not gender equality.

In 2020, a transgender woman tried to join a female university in Korea, only to be bullied away by the self-proclaimed feminists of the institutions, and gave up on joining the place. They speak of removing inequality in society while scoffing at the even more oppressed group in the society, which I see defeats the whole purpose.Also, most of the ministrys work can be and is overlapped with many of the other ministries departments, which often does a better job at it. Which is why the most (I hope) people against the ministry calls for the abolishment of the ministry AND let their work be covered by other ministries and departments that are already doing so. Not calling for all discourse of gender issue be wiped out. The ministry was the one that pushed for the notorious shutdown law that severely censors all form of gaming and banned all games for non-adults from midnight to 6am. This law ended up flagging that MINECRAFT as an adults game and led to the abolishment of the law only this year. Why is the ministry of gender equality in charge of this? God knows why. It also pushed for a lot of pseudohistory like claiming that Japanese sex slaves during WW2 were legitimate for averting raping in occupied territories and to avoid spread of diseases, or claiming that the phrase ladies first was coined from some evil male deeds from the medieval era that men threw women of lower rank into some dangerous rooms beforehand or something. Its a sh*tshow.Oh and one more stupid thing I remember was how they asked the National Fire Agency to lower their standards for women so more female firefighters can be employed. They really dont care about the structural issues of society but they just want some good statistics to save their face.And sure there might be people who were saved and helped by the ministry but often it is the other ministries and agencies we hear of when major rape or other criminal incidents occur. In fact, a lot of funds that are designated to help such victims or vulnerable peoples are not being used properly. For example, over 80% of budget allocated to support women involved in prostitution was testified to have been spent for the ministrys operating expensese (2015) and in 2020-2021, it was exposed that the ministry was selling off donated items for single moms for its own funds and used funds allocated for single moms to conduct workshops in jeju island (popular tourist destination).Also the ministrys proper name in Korean is Ministry of Women and Family not some gender equality they claim in their official English translatiion or something.",NHS

I dont think the BBC is doing the story justice by just representing one side (the women) as the victims and the people who think the gender equality ministry (Its actual name is Woman &amp; Family ministry) pursues radical policies and should be disbanded, as misogynists. Its a slow process but gender equality is getting better. There are ways in which women suffer disadvantages but men are at a disadvantage too in many respects, such as the fact that they have to serve in the military for two years and as a result enter into society at a later date compared to women. And those two years by most accounts of men is hellish. So its not perfect, there are stones to be thrown from both sides but rather than increasing the conflict, I think there needs to be more discourse and understanding. Ministries such as the gender equality ministry unfortunately was seen by many to be too toxic and divisive to serve in such a capacity.",NHS

Please, its not that the Korean males are sexists, we are just furious with our tax being wasted to a useless department whereas the money they provide for male soldiers are terrific. The new president is hoping to invest this money instead into military, so that males who have to waste their 2 years of brightest time of life can at least get paid properly. No improvement is being made with this department despite more money is being invested, this department does not even know what this country’s woman needs or how to improve their rights.

Also, they were criticized so harshly for putting some other really awkward and misleading gender concept, portraying pregnancy as adversity for pure women. 3. Except serious sex crimes and nonsensical judgement for perpetrators, Korea is one of the safest countries for women to live. No one cares you even though you go around the park at 3 A.M. and there is womens parking lot at every department store. Pregant women seat, which doesnt exist in any country at all is in every subway. But still that ministry emphasize that womens right in Korea is lower than India or Middle East countries.

(They made a blacklist to oppress several people or organisations who are not on the side of their government.And, it is also true that the ministry supports victims of sexual assult, but they are the same people who allied with members of a feminist group or a website called Megalia(메갈리아) which is very well known for anti-men sentiment. They were involved in several crimes, one of which is spreading a n*de photo of a male amateur model, to revenge against men. No, the man didnt do anything specifically. He was just a man, and they just wanted to revenge on any man they see. Another crime was to plan r@ping an Australian child and posting his n*de photos of him.  You can still find the screenshots of the comments taken at that time. The whole website was cheering and celebrating r@ping the child. and yes, she succeeded. a poor Australian boy was r@ped.They constantly say that men should be exterminated calling them Korean male insects(한남충). and they also say they also exterminate young children, calling them Korean male larva한남유충.And this ministry OFFICIALLY acknowledged them as 4th wave feminists by inviting to a governmental event.The self-claiming ministry of gender equality was also the one who opposed to laws for gender equality, only when it comes to mens rights. Korean men are forcefully conscripted and serve 1.5 - 2 years when girls enjoy their college life. and the men who served the army used to be given extra points when being hired by the government. And THAT is the ministry who pushed back the progress. They dont believe in gender equality. they believe in feminism.And the leftist congresswoman in the video, Park Jihyeon, was appointed by the leader of the party, Lee Jaemyung, to give an impression that their party is anti-sexist.

I am hetrosexual but I felt disgusted with his attack against this woman, regardless of her sexual orientation. I have friends who work in Nigeria. He explained to me that women there are treated as objects of self gratification for the male natives. Women there are not allowed to be equal partners, as it was in the 15th century in Europe. He is an abomination and should read ALL of his Bible. He has ignored what he needs to read. I am so angry!",NHS
